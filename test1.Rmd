## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#converting dates to numbers:

  if (all(is.na(out))) out <- suppressWarnings(readr::parse_date(x,
                      locale = locale(date_names = "en")))
  as.Date(out)
}

df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    Traded        = coerce_date(Traded),
    Filed         = coerce_date(Filed),
    last_modified = coerce_date(last_modified)
  )

#Bellow after we clean all of the data we can save it as a new file:

# write_csv(df, "project_clean.csv")
